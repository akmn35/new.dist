Description: The aim is to develop an R package,which is new.dist package,
    for the probability (density) function, the distribution function, the
    quantile function and the associated random number generation function
    for discrete and continuous distributions, which have recently been
    proposed in the literature. This package implements the following
    distributions: The Power Muth Distribution, A bimodal Weibull
    distribution, The discrete Lindley distribution, The gamma-Lomax
    distribution, weighted geometric distribution, A power log-Dagum
    distribution, kumaraswamy distribution, Lindley distribution, The
    unit-inverse Gaussian distribution, EP Distribution, Akash
    distribution, Ishita distribution, Maxwell distribution, The standard
    omega distribution, Slashed generalized Rayleigh distribution,
    Two-Parameter Rayleigh Distribution, On the Muth Distribution,
    Uniform-Geometric distribution, discrete Weibull distribution.
