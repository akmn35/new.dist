Description: The aim is to develop an R package, which is new.dist package,
    for the probability (density) function, the distribution function, the
    'quantile' function and the associated random number generation function
    for discrete and continuous distributions, which have recently been
    proposed in the literature. This package implements the following
    distributions: 'The Power Muth' Distribution, 'A Bimodal Weibull'
    Distribution, 'The Discrete Lindley' Distribution, 'The Gamma-Lomax'
    Distribution, 'Weighted Geometric' Distribution, 'A Power Log-Dagum'
    Distribution, 'Kumaraswamy' Distribution, 'Lindley' Distribution, 'The
    Unit-Inverse Gaussian' Distribution, 'EP' Distribution, 'Akash'
    Distribution, 'Ishita' Distribution, 'Maxwell' Distribution, 'The Standard
    Omega' Distribution, 'Slashed Generalized Rayleigh' Distribution,
    'Two-Parameter Rayleigh' Distribution, 'Muth' Distribution,
    'Uniform-Geometric' Distribution, 'Discrete Weibull' Distribution.
